✨ Lindsay Goff
💙 Healthcare Professional → 📊 Healthcare & Social Impact Data Analyst
Hey there! I’m Lindsay 😄
A former healthcare professional turned data analyst, blending clinical experience with a passion for social impact and public health. I analyze real-world problems — from maternal mortality to missing children to early-onset colon cancer — all with the goal of creating awareness, driving change, and making data approachable and human.

🌍 Projects Driven by Purpose
🔬 Maternal Mortality Analysis (2019–2025)

Understanding maternal health is a human rights issue.
This project uncovers disparities across age and ethnicity, giving voice to trends that too often go unseen.

🧬 Rising Young-Onset Colon Cancer Rates (in progress)

Young people are being diagnosed earlier — and the numbers are rising.
This project aims to highlight age-specific risks, geographic disparities, and emerging patterns using CDC/NPCR/SEER datasets.
Will include:

Python + SQL analysis

Demographic & environmental lenses

Clear, accessible visuals

Public-health–centered interpretation

🧒 Missing Children Data Project

Every missing child represents a community impacted, a family forever changed.
This project uses data to shed light on high-risk regions, age patterns, and time-based trends—supporting awareness, early prevention, and informed advocacy.

Includes:

Dataset cleaning + structuring

Trend analysis by age, state, timeframe

Social-impact–focused visuals

Approachable breakdowns for public understanding

💫 What Drives Me

I believe data should protect people, not overwhelm them.
Every chart represents real lives. Every dataset tells a story.
My work focuses on:

amplifying overlooked issues,

uncovering disparities,

and creating data that sparks change — not confusion.
